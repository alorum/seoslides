Add embeddable presentations to WordPress

WordPress: Pages, Posts and {now} Presentations

**Why add presentations?**

 - **Get started.** For the first time ever on WordPress, import your presentation, display in an embeddable player on your site, and in-plugin support.
 - **Get content.** Writer’s block is a bloggers worst enemy, especially when writing one page at a time. Turn one concept into multiple pages with presentations.
 - **Get noticed.** Presentations on your site are unexpected. Guaranteed to make you, your content, and your clients’ content stick out. Be a hit at WordCamp.
 - **Get embedded.** Presentations are fully embeddable. Slides contain your images, text and video – no matter where hosted. Own and control your distribution.
 - **Get linked.** Presentations contain fully customizable bylines. Link to your squeeze page from your viral conference keynote. Manage your lead pipeline.

**How can you and your clients use it? **

 - **Presenters:** Add fully-embeddable presentations to your posts and pages, then anywhere else using a slide-specific (meaning that slide will show up first) code.
 - **Marketers:** Every slide in your presentation is a SEO-optimizable page with unique and customizable URL backlinks
 - **Conferences:** Archive embeddable versions of every one of your presenter’s decks with a simple upload from a PDF deck
